Archivist
=========

This script enabled you to automatically deploy any PHP script with a native 
PHP support of GZ compression and *WITHOUT* needing PHAR extension.

The bin/build.php script will help you to easily create you customized php
archive.

To be executed the resulting archive will just need a native call from the
webserver or from the command line (support both).
